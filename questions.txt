searching with req.params (search/:last) or req.query (search?last=...);
url in "" gives all params when req.query and only first when no "".
Sequelize searching with multiple criterias: how to recognize AND/OR in url query or should I use different routes?
how to make queries for each possible situation? (seems impossible)
domain constraint checks for Sequelize.
are we using only url queries?
for updating PUT or PATCH?
PATCH with req.params or (/:id) or not?
