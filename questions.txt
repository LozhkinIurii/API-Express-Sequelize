searching with req.params (search/:last) or req.query (search?last=...);
Sequelize searching with multiple criterias: how to recognize AND/OR in url query or should I use different routes? USE &op=and&" / &op=or&
how to make queries for each possible situation? (seems impossible)  MAKE SIMPLE
domain constraint checks for Sequelize.  PK FK (because need to bind second table)
for updating PUT or PATCH?  BOTH
PATCH with req.params or (/:id) or not? (curl with -d {} or parameters in the end of url);  ID ENOUGH
